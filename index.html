<p style="background-color:pink"> If	the	saying	“you	are	what	you	eat”	is	true,	I	am	a	very	large	helping	of	
chocolate,	cookies, cake and	brownies.	I	am	different	from	most	other	girls	in	one	
way. I	love	to	eat. My	love for	food	has	been	apparent	since	day	one	when	I	was	
a	baby	and	consuming	such	a	large	amount. As	a	toddler	I	was	always	hungry	and	
constantly	eating. This	didn’t	seem	rare	because	many	toddlers	are	very	active	
and	work	up	an	appetite. I	was	a	competitive	gymnast	almost	my	entire	life. I	
believe	this	drove	my	metabolism	to	be	double	the	speed	of	other	girls	my	age	
and	size. College	has	really	fostered	my	love	for	eating	and	eating	
often. Unlimited	dining	halls	are	like	a	playground	for	my	hungry	tummy.</p> <p style="background-color:pink">	At 
home,	I	eat	less	often	so	I	have	larger	meals	when	I	do	eat. With	the	convenience	
of	food	being	ready	all	day	everyday	in	each	of	UGA’s	dining	halls,	I	eat	often	and	
have	smaller	meals.	My	favorite	part	in	each	hall	is	the	variety	of	desserts.	I love	
my	sweets.	Every	dining	area	has	something	different	to	offer.	At Bolton you	have	
your	traditional cookies	and	ice	creams,	with	occasional	peach	cobbler.	Ecv	has	
amazing	smoothies,	strawberry	being	my	favorite,	and	soft	serve	ice	cream.	Ohouse
always	has	fresh	made	cake.	And	last	but	not	least,	Snelling,	who	has	24	
hours	of	sweets.	These	vary	from donuts,	cookies,	and	even	chocolate	bars.	There	
are	many	times	I will	be	on	my	way	back	from	class	and	stop	for	a	Bolton cookie.	
A	day	does	not	pass	that	I do	not	have	dessert	here	at	UGA.	With	Bolton	and	Ohouse
being	so	conveniently located	to	my	dorm,	Creswell hall,	its	quite	
convenient to	go	whenever.</p> <p style="background-color:pink">
We	are	very	lucky to	have	such	a	large	variety	and	delicious	selection	and	
preparation	of	the	very	desserts	in	these	dinning	halls. Dessert to	me	is	more	
than	just	a	piece	of	cake. I	genuinely	enjoy	food	and eating. My	friends	and	
family	know	that	I	must	have	dessert	at	every	meal	before	I consider	to	be	
done. Dessert has	the	amazing	power	to	comfort	people	and	bring	them	together	
in	times	of	hardship	and	stress.	Nothing	compares	to	the	smile	on	my	face	after	a	
nice	warm cookie.	I	have	always	said	“eat your	dessert	first,	for	who	knows	what	
may	happen.” I	truly	believe in	this	as	dessert	has	become	a	huge	part	of	who	I
am.	</p>
